bugs:
- inputting multiple of the same pokemon/pokemon moves breaks the pokemon selection
- 4/30 issue now is the health is not saving after iterations of moves.
- need to uppercase all the names and moves
- pokemon should not be able to learn the same move more than once.
- calculate health


implement accuracy?
damge doesnt save into health
did a lot of testing the types and moves to make sure they were accurate.



Things I Learned: 




moar bugs:
- move buttons are not updating to new pokemon being sent out.
- trying to implement having multiple pokemon in party. having bugs where the turn based is off.
