<b>POKEMON BATTLE ARENA</b>


Project Description:
My app is a Pokemon arena where a user can select 3 pokemon and choose 4 moves. The user can battle the pokemon they choose against a computer who randomly creates their team of pokemon. When a pokemon reaches 0 HP, the pokemon faints and the user has to choose the next pokemon to fight in the arena. (ALL POKEMON AND ALL MOVES ARE AVAILABLE)

Technologies Used:
This project is written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
