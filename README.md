Project Description:
My app is a Pokemon arena where a user can select 3 pokemon with a preset move list. The user can battle the pokemon they choose against a computer who randomly creates their team of pokemon. When a pokemon reaches 0 HP, the pokemon faints and the user has to choose the next pokemon to fight in the arena.


MVP Goals:

As a player, I want to select the pokemon in a draft pick style.
As a player, I want to be able to choose which set of pokemon I want to battle with.
As a player, I want to be able to see which pokemon is battling at the moment and which pokemon I have left to enter the battle.
As a player, I should only be able to battle with one Pokemon at a time. 
As a player, there should be a ‘RUN’ button that lets me quit and reset the match.
As a player, I should know how much HP is left on my Pokemon and my opponent’s.
As a player, I should be able to choose which of the 4 moves I want to do per round.
As a player, I want to know what element each move is (electric, fire, water, ground)
